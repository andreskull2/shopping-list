## 🚀 About the Project

This project is a simple shopping list where users can add items, mark them as completed (strikethrough), and remove items from the list. The list saves data to **localStorage** so items persist after page reload.

The layout was created based on the Rocketseat Figma design, using **HTML** and **CSS** skills. For the programming logic, I reviewed concepts with the Dev Aprender - Jhonatan de Souza channel and applied the 5Qs method to plan the algorithm. I also counted on ChatGPT’s help to structure and validate the JavaScript code.

This project helped me solidify important fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and local storage.
